TextUML Toolkit
===============


[![Build Status on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/abstratt/textuml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abstratt/textuml)

TextUML is a textual notation for UML that supports:
- classes
- associations
- attributes
- operations
- constraints (invariants, preconditions)
- state machines
- activities and actions

TextUML can currently be used in three different ways:
- as a language plug-in for Eclipse, a.k.a. the TextUML Toolkit proper
- as a standalone command-line compiler
- as part of [Cloudfier](http://github.com/abstratt/cloudfier/), a web-based IDE for model-driven development based on TextUML.
